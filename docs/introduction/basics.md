# Introduction

Nano (NANO), formerly RaiBlocks (XRB), is a peer-to-peer digital currency that enables free, instant, and sustainable value transfer to anyone, anywhere in the world. It operates without intermediaries, using a distributed ledger with a unique block-lattice data structure collectively managed by a peer-to-peer network.

Nano was launched in October 2015 by Colin LeMahieu to address limitations in existing digital currencies. By allowing for scalability within the protocol and offering feeless transactions that typically achieve full confirmation in under one second, Nano is well suited for large scale adoption.
